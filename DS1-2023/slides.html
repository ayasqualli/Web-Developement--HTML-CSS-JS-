      Having foiled a jewelry store heist on my way to receive a medal from the
      President, imagine my embarrassment to notice a nasty laser burn on my
      cape. There was no time to fly back to base and change into my spare
      costume, even at my speed. Thank goodness for Power Outfitters! They had
      my size and style in stock, in just the right shade of red, and at a great
      price, too. I went back after the ceremony and bought five more capes,
      plus matching gauntlets!
